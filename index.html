<emu-clause id="Atomics.microwait">
  <h1><span class="secnum">1</span> Atomics.microwait ( [ <var>iterationNumber</var> ] )</h1>
  <p>This method performs the following steps when called:</p>
  <emu-alg><ol><li>If <var>iterationNumber</var> is not <emu-val>undefined</emu-val> and <emu-xref aoid="IsIntegralNumber"><a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-isintegralnumber">IsIntegralNumber</a></emu-xref>(<var>iterationNumber</var>) is <emu-val>false</emu-val>, throw a <emu-val>TypeError</emu-val> exception.</li><li>Return <emu-val>undefined</emu-val>.</li></ol></emu-alg>
  <emu-note><span class="note">Note 1</span><div class="note-contents">
    <p>This method is designed for programs implementing spinlocks, such as those inside of mutexes, to provide a hint to the CPU that it is spinning while waiting on a value. It has no observable behaviour other than timing.</p>
    <p>Implementations are expected to implement a pause or yield instruction if the best practices of the underlying architecture recommends such instructions in spin loops. For example, the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/671488/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-optimization-reference-manual-volume-1.html">Intel Optimization Manual</a> recommends the <code>pause</code> instruction.</p>
  </div></emu-note>
  <emu-note><span class="note">Note 2</span><div class="note-contents">
    <p>Due to the overhead of function calls, it is reasonable that an inlined call to this method in an optimizing compiler waits a different amount of time than an uninlined call.</p>
  </div></emu-note>
  <emu-note><span class="note">Note 3</span><div class="note-contents"></div></emu-note>
    <p>It is common practice for spin loops to have exponential backoff. For this purpose, <var>iterationNumber</var> is a hint parameter. For integral numbers <var>N</var>, <code>`Atomics.microwait(N)</code> should wait at most as long as <code>`Atomics.microwait(N+1)</code>.</p>
