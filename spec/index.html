  <h1>Atomics.pause ( [ _iterationNumber_ ] )</h1>
  <p>This method performs the following steps when called:</p>
  <emu-alg>
    1. If _iterationNumber_ is not *undefined*, then
      1. If IsIntegralNumber(_iterationNumber_) is *false*, throw a *TypeError* exception.
      1. If ‚Ñù(_iteration_number_) &lt; 0, throw a *RangeError* exception.
    1. Return *undefined*.
  </emu-alg>
  <emu-note>
    <p>This method is designed for programs implementing spinlocks, such as those inside of mutexes, to provide a hint to the CPU that it is spinning while waiting on a value. It has no observable behaviour other than timing.</p>
    <p>Implementations are expected to implement a pause or yield instruction if the best practices of the underlying architecture recommends such instructions in spin loops. For example, the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/671488/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-optimization-reference-manual-volume-1.html">Intel Optimization Manual</a> recommends the <code>pause</code> instruction.</p>

  <emu-note>
    <p>Due to the overhead of function calls, it is reasonable that an inlined call to this method in an optimizing compiler waits a different amount of time than an uninlined call.</p>
  </emu-note>
  <emu-note>
    <p>It is common practice for spin loops to have exponential backoff. For this purpose, _iterationNumber_ is a hint parameter. For integral numbers _N_, <code>Atomics.pause(N)</code> should wait at most as long as <code>Atomics.pause(N+1)</code>.</p>
